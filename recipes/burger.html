    <p>We fixed the chicken burger, and all it really took was stirring in a couple spoons of chimichurri sauce. No longer sort of dry and kind of boring, this is one of the best burgers you'll ever have.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Chimichurri Sauce</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup Italian parsley leaves</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fresh cilantro leaves</li> 
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh oregano leaves</li> 
        <li>2 cloves garlic, sliced</li> 
        <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li> 
        <li>2 tablespoons white wine vinegar</li> 
        <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li> 
        <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li> 
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cumin</li> 
        <li>1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li> 
    </ul>
    <h4>Chicken Burgers</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds boneless skinless chicken thighs</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons breadcrumbs (optional)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1/3 cup mayonnaise</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>To make chimichurri, chop herbs with a sharp knife until fine; add sliced garlic to the mixture. Continue chopping until mixture is very fine; transfer to a bowl. Stir in the 1/4 cup olive oil, white wine vinegar, the 1/4 teaspoon salt, black pepper, cumin, and red pepper flakes. Wrap and refrigerate until needed.

        </li>
        <li>To make burgers, place chicken thighs in the freezer until firm and half-frozen, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place thighs on a cutting board, and using a large sharp knife or heavy cleaver, chop until it resembles coarsely ground meat. (Alternatively, place chicken in a food processor; pulse on and off, scraping sides often, until texture resembles coarsely ground meat.)</li>
        <li>Transfer chicken to a bowl, add the 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and 1/4 cup chimichurri sauce. Use a fork to mix thoroughly.

        </li>
        <li>Using damp hands, form chicken mixture into 4 equal-sized patties, about 1/2-inch thick. Cover and refrigerate until chilled, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir together mayonnaise and  remaining chimichurri sauce to make spread for buns; refrigerate until needed.

        </li>
        <li>Remove burgers from the fridge; sprinkle both sides with breadcrumbs.</li>
        <li>Add olive oil to a large non-stick skillet and set over medium high heat. When hot, but before oil starts smoking, add burgers, and cook about 5 minutes per side, or until chicken is cooked through. An instant read thermometer inserted near the center should read 145 to 150 degrees F (63 to 65 degrees C).

        </li>
        <li>Let burgers rest for a minute or two. Serve on buns spread with chimichurri mayo and the fixings of your choice.</li>
    </ol>
